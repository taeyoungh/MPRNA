## A: Cloning

**_Digestion_**  
1. Cut 50 ng ePCR-amplified oligo-pool (total dependent on ePCR yield) in Eppendorf Low bind tubes and 6 µg MPRNA empty vector each with proper REs.  
2. 1 µl CIP (NEB) treatment of backbone for 30 min @ 37°C.  
3. Qiagen PCR clean up of oligo-pools and gel extract of SfiI linearized backbone.  
4. Measure concentrations with Qubit.  

**_Ligation_**  
5. Setup a 20 µl ligation rxn with concentrated 1 µl T4 DNA Ligase (400 U/µl) from NEB (or Quick Ligase) in 10x T4 DNA ligase buffer (make sure the buffer is free of precipitate: warm it up and vortex).  
6. Use 100 ng backbone + 4 x molar excess of oligopool.  
7. Incubate 16-18 hours @ 16°C.  
8. Place on ice until ready for transformation.  

**_Transformation_**  
9. Pre-warm the small waterbath at 42oC
10. Pre-warm the vial of SOC medium and 20-22 LB+ampicillin plates @ 37°C.  
11. Spin the ligation reaction and place on ice.  
12. Thaw, on ice for exactly 10min, 10-11 vial of One Shot cells.
13. Pipet x µl (2 to 5) of each ligation reaction directly into the competent cells, rinse the tip by pipetting up and down ONCE and mix by a quick hand shaking (4-5 times) followed by gently flicking the tube (4-5 times) [Do not pipette up and down but for the first tip rinsing].  
14. Incubate on ice for 30 minutes, then 42°C for exactly 30 sec, then on ice for 2 min (can be a bit more but no longer than 5min).  
15. Add 250 µl of pre-warmed SOC medium to each vial.  
16. Place the vials in the Eppendorf thermomixer @ 37°C and shake @ 900rpm for exactly 1 hour.  
17. Spread each transformation on 2 ampicillin LB agar plates (150 µl transformation/plate).  
18. Dry ~5min.  
19. Invert the plates and incubate @ 37°C O/N – 15-17 hours.  
20. Check for growth. If successful, proceed to maxiprep.

**_Maxiprep_**  
21. Fill 3-4 50ml Falcon with LB+ampicillin.  
22. Add 5ml to 2 of the plates and scrape (use a cell scraper).  
23. Place both plate at an angle (on the cover) to collect the scraped colonies on one side.  
24. Repeat with 2 more plates.  
25. Collect the scraped LB from all 4 plates in a 50ml Falcon.  
26. Wash once, to get all the colonies, by adding 5-10 ml (based on # of colonies) of LB to the 1st plate.  
27. Transfer the “LB wash” to the 2nd plate.  
28. Repeat until all 4 plates are done.  
29. Collect in the Falcon tube and continue with 4 more plates until all are done.  
30. Spin @ 5,000 rpm for 15 min (Eppedorf table top in Fairchild).
- Note: the pellets may be frozen before Maxi. In this case thaw them for 10-15 min before proceeding with the Maxi.
31. Proceed with the Maxi prep high yield (2-3 Maxi depending on the volume of LB needed to scrape the plate).  
32. Elute in a 1.5 low-bind eppedorf tube using 300ul EB/prep.  
33. Pool the eluates.  
34. Measure concentration with nanodrop.
